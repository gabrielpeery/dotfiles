There are various fonts and terminal themes.  They only work under specific systems (OSX).

To install:

	> open Presenter.terminal
	> open Pro.terminal
	> ./iterm_profiles.sh
	> open DroidSansMonoSlashed/Droid\ Sans\ Mono\ Slashed\ for\ Powerline.ttf
	
The iterm_profiles.sh has a hard coded source, so change that to match where you are storing the dotfile repo.
